The database created by the student includes captures of legal traffic and fraudulent traffic simulated using the HTTP Injector application, together with the flows corresponding to both types of traffic. 
To generate this dataset (fraudulent) Masking techniques have been used for different SNIs such as:
- "www.spotify.com;open.spotify.com;open.spotifycdn.com;api.spotify.com"
- "m.waze.com;m.twitter.com;twitter.com;c.whatsapp.net;media.whatsapp.net;web.whatsapp.com"
- "web.whatsapp.com;media.whatsapp.net;c.whatsapp.net"

In the generation process, 50 captures of each type of traffic were obtained, with a duration of 20 minutes each, resulting in a total of 1,000 minutes of traffic for each type. 
This translates into 100 traffic captures in total and therefore 100 stream files, which equals 2,000 minutes of traffic in total. 
The traffic generated is very varied, with the idea of allowing generalisation of the identification models and avoiding over-fitting.

Based on this total dataset, two datasets were created for testing:
- Dataset 1: Contains network traffic generated by legal usage and simulated by HTTP Injector. 
- Dataset 2: Contains the flows generated by CICFlowMeter for dataset 1.

Due to the large size of the files in dataset 1, they are divided in the repository in several zip files indicating the content of each one.
